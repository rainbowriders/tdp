            <p>Tension at work has not spared anyone. But work relations are of utmost importance as we get to spend most of our
                day time communicating with our colleagues. Sometimes " a very little key will open a very heavy door".
                A kind gesture is needed to cope with stress and open the way for positive working environment.
                Team Daily Praise gives everyone this little key ;)</p>
            <p>With Team Daily Praise anyone within your Slack team can use a command like <strong>/praise John</strong> to commend teammates. At the end of the day
            you can check who has collected most commends. One person can commend another only once a day. The ranking list can be pulled anytime
            using <strong>/praise-list</strong> command.</p>
